1. Use pre_processing.py to generate C++ readable tree and serialize it into c_search_tree. (remember to clear all old files before you generate new ones.)

2. Use pre_processing_func.py to generate functions for each program into c_predicates.cpp (remember to clear all old files before you generate new ones.)
